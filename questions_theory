How to find size of struct 

struct xyz *ptr; 
size = (char*)(ptr+1) - (char*)ptr;

the logic here is when we have a pointer to the struct; ptr+1 will point to next memory location which is after sizeof struct 
so ptr+1 - ptr will give the size of the struct. 

another way is using sizeof function 
struct xyz *ptr; 
size = sizeof(struct xyz);


what is difference between array and pointer. 
array is aderived data structure which allocates contagious memory of fixed size of the same type of elements. 
by definition of array int a[x] ; x bytes of contigious memory of type int  will be allocated 
and a is the name of pointer to first element. 
pointer is something we define as a variable which points to the address of any variable of type pointer type .
